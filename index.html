    const text = `My Dearest Riri,

I want to start this letter by saying thank you for everything that happened last week while we were together. I‚Äôm so deeply grateful for all of it, and it makes my heart very, very happy knowing that you‚Äôre willing to try again‚Äîthis time not just working on our relationship, but also on ourselves.

It makes me emotional reminiscing about how we spent the whole week together. It was the perfect mix of happiness, kilig, sadness, and most of all, love‚Äîthe kind of love that overcomes everything and brings us closer than ever.

I remember when we were cleaning up after setting up your table and came across your old diary (while there's an auto play song playing in the background that really relates on what is happening). It felt like such a perfect coincidence, like something straight out of a movie. After this week, I just love you more than ever. I want to court you again, suyuin, baby you, mag pa-baby din, and shower you with affection all day long. That‚Äôs why I‚Äôve been missing you a little extra yesterday‚ÄîI really miss being with you all day. Right now, I‚Äôm trying to keep it low-key, because even I might get overwhelmed! HAHAHA.

I want you to know how grateful I am to have you, and how thankful I am that you love me‚Äînot because you have to, but because you choose to. I‚Äôm not going to waste anything anymore. I want to cherish every moment we spend together. I want to be the one who can give a shoulder to lean on, the one who wipes not just your tears but also your sweat after we do something silly or after we play some random, cute physical games.

I want to be there not just in the happy times but also through our lowest moments‚Äîjust like I promised when we were together, holding our promise ring like I was proposing to you. HAHAHA. That‚Äôs honestly the sweetest, cutest thing I‚Äôve ever done from my perspective‚Äîall of that was real, and I meant it with all of my heart.

Please stay with me as we figure everything out, okay? I want to find all the how‚Äôs with you‚Äîand only you. I don‚Äôt want anybody else, hun.

I love you so much, my Wawis.
XOXO`;
